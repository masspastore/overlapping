\title{
Nonparametric Bootstrap for estimated overlapping area
}
\description{
Bootstrap the estimated overlapping area of two or more kernel density estimations from empirical data.
}
\usage{
boot.overlap( x, B = 1000, ... )
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{list of numerical vectors to be compared; each vector is an element of the list}
  \item{B}{integer, number of bootstrap draws}
  \item{...}{options, see function \code{\link{overlap}} for details}
}
\details{
If the list \code{x} contains more than two elements (i.e. more than two distributions) it computes bootstrap overlapping between all \eqn{q} number of paired distributions. For example, if \code{x} contains three elements, then \eqn{q = 3}; if \code{x} contains four elements, then \eqn{q = 6}, and so on.
}
\value{
It returns a list containing the following components:
  \item{OVboot_stats }{Data frame \eqn{q \times 3}; each row  containing the following statistics:
  \code{estOV}, estimated overlapping area, \eqn{\hat{\eta}};
  \code{bias},  difference between the bootstrap's expected value and the observed value of the overlapping area: \eqn{E(\hat{\eta}^*)-\hat{\eta}};
  \code{se}, bootstrap standard error \eqn{\sigma_{\hat{\eta}}}.}
  \item{OVboot_dist }{Matrix \eqn{B \times q}, \code{B} rows (bootstrap replicates) and \eqn{q} columns (depending on the number of elements of \code{x}); each column is a boostrap distribution of an overlapping index. }
