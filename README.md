### Estimation of Overlapping in Empirical Distributions

Overlapping can be defined as the area intersected by two or more probability density functions. The main idea of this package is to offer an easy way to quantify the similarity (or the difference) between two or more empirical distributions.

# Set up

To install this github version type in R:

```{r}
# if devtools is not installed yet: 
# install.packages( "devtools" )  
library( devtools )
install_github( "masspastore/overlapping" )
```

# Main function

The main function, **overlap**, gives the overlapped estimated area of two or more empirical distributions.

* **overlap**
    + Input: a list of distributions to be compared; each distribution is an element of the list.
    + Output: a data frame with information used for computing overlapping (only for graphical purposes) and estimated overlapped areas relative to each couple of distributions.
     

# Examples

```{r}
set.seed( 20150605 )

# creating a list with three different empirical distributions
x <- list( X1 = rnorm(100), X2 = rt(50,8), X3 = rchisq(80,2) )

out <- overlap( x, plot = TRUE )
out$OV # estimated overlapped areas
```
